# Vision

## Goal
Expand Repo Stats beyond VSCode so the same insights can appear where developers already work. The long-term aim is a second surface (e.g., a browser extension on GitHub) that presents the same core stats and views, while the VSCode extension remains the primary, high-fidelity source.

## Why
- Meet developers in context: repo stats should be visible inside the repo experience, not only inside the editor.
- Reuse what already works: keep shared concepts, language, and visual affordances across surfaces.
- Grow adoption: browser reach makes it easier to discover and try Repo Stats.

## Principles
- Consistent experience: same core metrics, same terminology, same visual language.
- Honest data: if a platform can only provide approximate or limited data, make that clear.
- Low friction: minimal setup for users; no complex infrastructure required to get started.
- Incremental delivery: ship small, usable slices rather than a big-bang rewrite.

## Scope (for now)
- Capture the intent and direction only.
- Defer architecture decisions, tooling choices, and implementation details.
- Keep focus on current VSCode roadmap while preserving the option to expand later.

## Non-goals (for now)
- Committing to any specific monorepo structure or build system.
- Promising exact feature parity across platforms.
- Designing the final GitHub UI integration approach.
